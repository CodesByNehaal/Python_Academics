# All my Academic Assignments from the course "Logic Development in Python" during my FY

PRACTICAL 1.1 : To accept an object mass in kilograms and velocity in meters per second and display its momentum and energy. Momentum=mc, Energy=mc2 where m is the mass of the object and c is its velocity.

#PRACTICAL 1.2 : Find the area volume of any given shape like cube ,sphere or cuboid.

#PRACTICAL 1.3 : Calculate the percentage loss or the percentage profit by taking the cost price & selling price from the user.

#PRACTICAL 1.4 : To calculate the mileage of a bike or car in KMPL. Input: Distance traveled in Meters and Amount of fuel used in Millilitres.

#PRACTICAL 2.1 : Write a Python program for following conditions.
If n is single digit print square of it.
If n is two digit print square root of it.
If n is three digit print cube root of it.


#PRACTICAL 2.2 :  Aman is playing a game which has 3 levels. if Aman surpasses level 1 give him reward of 1000 coins and if clears level 2 reward him with 2000 coins and if clears level 3 reward him with 3000 coins if he fails any level tell him to try again (*Rewarding and providing restart can be just print statemnts*) (Surpassing of level can be done by defeating each level character consider level 1 character as A level 2 character as B level 3 character as C)

#PRACTICAL 2.3 : A student will not be allowed to sit in exam if his/her attendence is less than 75%.
#Take following input from user
#Number of classes held
#Number of classes attended.
#And print
#percentage of class attended
#Is student allowed to sit in exam or not.


#PRACTICAL 2.4 : Check whether the triangle is equilateral, scalene, or isosceles.

#PRACTICAL 3: To accept students five courses marks and compute his/her result. Student is passing if he/she scores marks equal to and above 40 in each course. If student scores aggregate greater than 75%, then the grade is distinction. If aggregate is 60>= and <75 then the grade is first division. If aggregate is 50>= and <60, then the grade is second division. If aggregate is 40>= and <50, then the grade is third division.

#PRACTICAL 4: Write a program in Python to enter two unequal nos. if first no. is greater than display square of the smaller no. and cube of the greater no. otherwise vice-versa. If no. are equal display the message both no. are equal find square, square root and cube root of a number.

#PRACTICAL 5: To check whether input number is Armstrong number or not. An Armstrong number is an integer with three digits such that the sum of the cubes of its digits is equal to the number itself. Ex. 371.

#PRACTICAL 6: Write a Python program to print different patterns.

#PRACTICAL 7.1. Solve the Fibonacci sequence using recursive function in Python.

#PRACTICAL 7.2. WAP to calculate factorial of an input number. Sample O/P:- 5*4*3*2*1=120

#PRACTICAL 7.3. WAP to print first 50 natural numbers using recursion.

#PRACTICAL 7.4. WAP to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to n using recursion.

#PRACTICAL 7.5. WAP to print the list elements using recursion.

#PRACTICAL 7.6. WAP to get the largest element of a list using recursion.

#PRACTICAL 7.7. WAP to find the first capital letter in a string using recursion.

#PRACTICAL 8: Write a Python program to perform following string operations. a) String concatenation b) String Reverse c) String compare d) String length e) Palindrome f) Case change.

#PRACTICAL 9: Write a Python program to create small application based on Linear Search algorithm.

#PRACTICAL 10: Choose cricket team of eleven players find the captain of the team (consider tallest person as a captain) using dictionary.

#PRACTICAL 11: Write a Python program to perform addition and multiplication of 2 matrices.

#PRACTICAL 12.1. Write Python class for bank customer with withdraw and deposit operations (use inheritance (Introduce class, object concepts).

#PRACTICAL 12.2. Using concepts of polymorphism write Python application program.

#PRACTICAL 12.3: Write a NumPy program for Plotting and analyzing data.

#PRACTICAL EXAM: #PROBLEM STATEMENT : CREATING A REGISTRATION/LOGIN INTERFACE FOR USERS AND STORING THE DATA IN A FILE.
